1. If the relationship between estimated surplus (x) and actual surplus (y) is represented by linear regression model of y = β<sub>1</sub>x + β<sub>0</sub> +ε, Find β<sub>1</sub> (slope) and β<sub>0</sub> (intercept). Please interpret the regression coefficients β<sub>1</sub> and β <sub>0</sub>.
2. Suppose the financial secretary estimate the government surplus for this financial year to be -34. Based on the regression model, what is the anticipated actual surplus?
