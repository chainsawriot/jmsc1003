Simulation of CLT

# Task 1

(5 marks)

Excel function RANDBETWEEN() is random number generator that can generate a sequence of (pseudo-)random numbers with uniform distribution. Computer RNG is the essential component of Monte Carlo simulation.

Using RANDBETWEEN() to simulate flipping 3 coins, 10 coins and 20 coins for 5000 times, plot the probability of face from each trial as a histogram. (i.e. there should be 3 histograms, each for one simulations. The histograms should have the same binning for easy comparison.)

Calculate the mean and standard deviation (hint: using STDEVPA) of sample means from 3 simulations. Do they have the same "mean of sample means"? Why do they have different standard deviations? Explain your answer using the Central Limit Theorem.

# Task 2

Using the UCBAdmissions.csv dataset. Try the following.

1. Create random samples of 100, 500 and 1,000 students
2. Calculate the male and female admission rates for each random sample. Compare it with the whole population from problem set #5.
3. State the expected results of the sampling distributions of repeating the analysis in 100, 500 and 1,000 randomly selected students for multiple time. What is the practical implication?
