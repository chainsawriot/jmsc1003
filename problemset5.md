(4 marks) HKU Public Opinion Program has conducted an exit-poll to study the voters who turned-out for the 2007 election. Candidate Anson Chan and Candidate Regina Ip were the only two candidates in that election.
In the exit-poll, HKU found that:

- Among the voters, 55.5% of them voted for Anson Chan;
- Among the voters who voted for Anson Chan, 45% of them had participated in at least one protests;

Event A and Event M are defined as follows:

A: The event of a voter voted for Candidate Anson Chan

M: The event of a voter who had participated in at least one protests

1. Use the notation of conditional probability, what is the 45% in the HKU exit-poll result
(Among the voters who voted for Anson Chan, 45% of them had participated in at least one protest)?

2. Given a person who voted for Anson Chan is chosen, what is the probability for this person had never participated in any protest?
3. Given a person who had participated in at least one protests, what is the probability for this person voted for Anson Chan?
4. Given a person who had never participated in any protest, what is the probability for this person voted for Regina Ip?

| Support   | 63      | 316     | 145  |
