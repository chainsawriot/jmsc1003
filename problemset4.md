# Problem Set #4

Probability

# Problem statement

Understand the probability terminology

# Task 1

(4 marks)

Using the titanic dataset, calcuate the follow probabilities

- pclass: passenger class
- survived: 1 = yes, 0 = no
- sex: sex

1. Prob(survived = 0)
2. Prob(sex = female)
3. Prob(sex = female ∪ pclass = 1)
4. Prob(sex = female ∩ pclass = 1)
5. Prob(sex = female | survived = 1)
6. Prob(survived = 1 | sex = female)
7. Prob(pclass = 3 | survived = 1)
8. Prob(pclass = 3 | sex = female)

Do you agree female passengers on Titanic had a higher survival rate?

# Task 2

(3 marks)

Generate a statistical table from this website

http://cdcf.ugc.edu.hk/cdcf/searchStatSiteReport.do

Type of statistical table: 01

Academic Year: 2008/09 - 2014/15

To be analysed by: Institution, Level of Study, Sex (i.e. exclude mode of study)

Using only the data from 2014/15, calculate the following probabilities

1. Prob(Institution = HKU)
2. Prob(Institution = HKU ∪ Level of Study = SD)
3. Prob(Institution = HKU ∩ Level of Study = SD)
4. Prob(Gender = Female | Institution = HKU)
5. Prob(gender = Female | (Institution = HKU ∩ Level of Study = Ug))

# Task 3

2013 Exam question

(4 marks) HKU Public Opinion Program has conducted an exit-poll to study the voters who turned-out for the 2007 election. Candidate Anson Chan and Candidate Regina Ip were the only two candidates in that election.
In the exit-poll, HKU found that:

- Among the voters, 55.5% of them voted for Anson Chan;
- Among the voters who voted for Anson Chan, 45% of them had participated in at least one protests;
- Among the voters who voted for Regina Ip, 12% of them had participated in at least one protests.

Event A and Event M are defined as follows:

A: The event of a voter voted for Candidate Anson Chan

M: The event of a voter who had participated in at least one protests

1. Use the notation of conditional probability, what is the 45% in the HKU exit-poll result
(Among the voters who voted for Anson Chan, 45% of them had participated in at least one protest)?

2. Given a person who voted for Anson Chan is chosen, what is the probability for this person had never participated in any protest?
3. Given a person who had participated in at least one protests, what is the probability for this person voted for Anson Chan?
4. Given a person who had never participated in any protest, what is the probability for this person voted for Regina Ip?
