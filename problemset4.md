# Problem statement

Understand the probability terminology

# Task 1

(4 marks)

Using the titanic dataset, calcuate the follow probabilities

- pclass: passenger class
- survived: 1 = yes, 0 = no
- sex: sex

1. Prob(survived = 0)
2. Prob(sex = female)
3. Prob(sex = female ∪ pclass = 1)
4. Prob(sex = female ∩ pclass = 1)
5. Prob(sex = female | survived = 1)
6. Prob(survived = 1 | sex = female)
7. Prob(pclass = 3 | survived = 1)
8. Prob(pclass = 3 | sex = female)

Do you agree female passengers on Titanic had a higher survival rate?

# Task 2

(3 marks)

Generate a statistical table from this website

http://cdcf.ugc.edu.hk/cdcf/searchStatSiteReport.do

Select: Student (Headcount)

Type of statistical table: 01

Academic Year: 2008/09 - 2014/15

To be analysed by: Institution, Level of Study, Sex (i.e. exclude mode of study)

Using only the data from 2014/15, calculate the following probabilities

1. Prob(Institution = HKU)
2. Prob(Institution = HKU ∪ Level of Study = SD)
3. Prob(Institution = HKU ∩ Level of Study = SD)
4. Prob(Gender = Female | Institution = HKU)
5. Prob(gender = Female | (Institution = HKU ∩ Level of Study = Ug))
