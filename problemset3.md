# Problem Set #3

## Task 1

(2 marks)

Using the data from B302 and D303

* Calculate the proportion of working age population (15-64) with post-secondary education and proportion of families with < $6,000 monthly income **for each DCCA**. Display the results as a graph to show the relationship between education and poverty.

## Task 2

(3 marks)

Write a short story (< 200 words) to describe your findings from Task 1

## Task 3

(3 marks)

Assuming the proportion of working age population of families with < $6,000 monthly income (*fam6k*) Calculate the Z score and theorectical probability of DCCAs with higher *fam6k* than that of

* Central and Western - University
* Sham Shui Po - Cheung Sha Wan
* Yuen Long - Kam Tin

## Task 4

(2 marks)

Calculate the interquartile range of the *fam6k* and calculate the theorectical range with the Z score. Do you agree the distribution of *fam6k* is normally distributed?
