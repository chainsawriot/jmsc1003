# Problem Set #2

Analysis of data from census

Dataset : http://www.census2011.gov.hk/en/main-table.html

# Background

Hong Kong is divided into 412 District Council Constituency Areas (DCCA) under 18 districts. Each DCCA has a population of around 17,000 people on average.

# Problem statement

Based on the census data, Jenna would like to show the relationship between poverty and education.

## Task 0: warm up excercises

* Verify the claim that 'Each DCCA has a population of around 17,000 people on average' using excel and the data from the census table A303. (1 marks)

* Using the data from A303, Calculate the Male to Female Ratios for the four age groups (< 15, 15-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65+) and display them in a graph. (1 marks)

## Task 1

(3 marks)

Using the data from D303

* Calculate the average proportion of families with < $6,000 monthly income **for each districts**. Display the results as a table and also a graph that can clealy show the order. Which district has the highest proportion of poor family?

## Task 2

(3 marks)

Using the data from B302

* Calculate the average proportion of working age population (15-64) with post-secondary education **for each districts**. Display the results as a table and also a graph that can clealy show the order. Which district has the lowest proportion of working age population with post-secondary education?

## Task 3

(2 marks)

Using the data from B302 and D303

* Calculate the proportion of working age population (15-64) with post-secondary education and proportion of families with < $6,000 monthly income **for each DCCA**. Display the results as a graph to show the relationship between education and poverty.

## Task 4

(3 marks)

Write a short story (< 200 words) to describe your findings from Task 1-3

## Task 5

(3 marks)

Assuming the proportion of working age population of families with < $6,000 monthly income (*fam6k*) Calculate the Z score and theorectical probability of DCCAs with higher *fam6k* than that of

* Central and Western - University
* Sham Shui Po - Cheung Sha Wan
* Yuen Long - Kam Tin

## Task 6

(2 marks)

Using the data from B119

Calculate the following Probabilities

* P(A), where A = {Degree course}
* P(B), where B = {Hong Kong Chinese}
* P(C), where C = {Japanese}
* P(A ∪ B), P(A ∩ B), P(A | B), P(B | A)

(2 marks)

Calculate P(B ∩ C)
